MantisTouch Redirect
====================

A plugin that automatically redirects from MantisBT to MantisTouch when a user is accessing
MantisBT from a mobile browser.  This plugin is designed to replace the $g_mantistouch_url
config option in MantisBT v1.2.x.

This can be used along with your licensed instance of MantisTouch or the demo instance at
http://mantisbt.mobi

To disable the redirection, uninstall the plugin.
